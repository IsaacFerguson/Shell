My program does not fully work so I am going to talk about why i think they are 
not working and how I tested them. 

Piping is the first problem. I think my idea
for how to pipe the IO makes sense but in pratice the first program I run errors
when reading the next token after the first arg. I think the problem is coming from 
how I call the funcs to run. 

The two bulitin commands that gave me issue are cd and dir. The problem I had with dir 
that it could never find the dir I wanted it to look at. cd just did not work. My guess
for both cd and dir is that i do not really understand how chrdir and opendir work.

Echo is also problematic. it works the first time you use it but after that it 
no loger just prints whats after echo and reapeats the whole line.

these are some of the commands I used for testing:

ls > output.txt
ls >> output.txt
wc < input.txt
wc < input.txt > output.txt
wc < input.txt >> output.txt
echo Hello | wc
vim &
ls
ls | wc
./test2 | ./test3
ls -la | wc
ping -c 2 google.com &
./test2
ls -la > lsOutput.txt
wc < lsOutput.txt

not all worked when testing just a list of some that I tried.
